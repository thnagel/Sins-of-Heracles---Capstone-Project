The Nemean Lion is the boss of the [Nemean Valley](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20World%2FMain%20places%2FNemean%20valley). It is therefore the final fight of the first zone of _[Sins of Heracles](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=Sins%20of%20Heracles)_ as well as the first Labor of [Heracles](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FHeracles).

## Description:

The Nemean Lion stands out due to its size; it is indeed twice as large as a standard lion, standing around 1.80 meters tall and measuring 4.5 meters from head to tail.  
It is also characterized by its extremely tough, almost impenetrable skin and its immense strength.

### In the myth:

In the myth of the Twelve Labors, Heracles first tries to attack it with a bow. However, the arrows he shoots simply bounce off the lion’s skin. He then attempts to knock it out with his club, which also proves useless. Finally, he decides to strangle the lion with all his strength, which ultimately ends the reign of the Nemean Lion.  
Heracles then uses the lion’s claws to cut its skin and make a cuirass, and uses the skull as a helmet.

### In _Sins of Heracles_:

For gameplay purposes, the Nemean Lion can be defeated with regular attacks and therefore does not need to be strangled like in the myth.
