The Chimera is a mythological creature associated with the myth of Bellerophon. It is described as a monster with the body and head of a lion, the tail of a serpent, and the head of a goat on its back that can breathe fire.
## In the myth:

In the myth of Bellerophon, the Chimera is a fearsome monster that must be eliminated at all costs. The Greek hero Bellerophon is therefore commissioned by a king of Lycia, Iobates, to kill the creature.

Bellerophon, riding the winged horse Pegasus, manages to kill the Chimera by shooting a lead arrow into the beast's mouth, which melts on contact with the flames and burns its insides.
