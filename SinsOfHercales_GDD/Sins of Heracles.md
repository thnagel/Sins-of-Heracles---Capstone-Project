*Sins of Heracles* is an action RPG and Souls-like video game in which players immerse themselves in the world of Greek mythology, playing as [Heracles](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FHeracles) (or Hercules) on his quest to complete the Twelve Labours.

## Genres :

The main genre of *Sins of Heracles* is *Action-RPG*.

The secondary genre of *Sins of Heracles* is *Souls-like*.
The *Souls-like* genre is characteristic of games that require the player to persevere and show determination in battles against demanding and difficult bosses whose attacks are predefined according to an evolving pattern. The player must analyse this pattern and adapt to it in order to defeat the boss. The player must progress through different environments in order to improve their skills, statistics, equipment, etc., in order to maximise their chances of defeating the boss and advancing in the game. They are free to decide when to face the boss, allowing them to choose the combat experience they want to have.
This type of game has become very popular with the rise of *Dark Souls (FromSoftware)* in 2011 and its sequels in 2014 and 2016, as well as titles such as *Hollow Knight (Team Cherry)* in 2017 and *Elden Ring (FromSoftware)* in 2022, which even won Game of the Year.
Souls-like games are a genre that appeals to and attracts many players who want to be challenged and push themselves to their limits.

## Artistic direction :

In terms of visual art direction, *Sins of Heracles* is defined by a semi-realistic, cartoon-inspired style. Its main inspiration is *Immortal Fenyx Rising (Ubisoft)*, which adopts this cartoon aesthetic with a touch of realism, without going overboard into pure cartoon. This style is accompanied by colourful and verdant settings that bring the environments in which the player evolves to life. *Sins of Heracles* thus stands out from many Souls-like games, which generally adopt a very realistic and darker atmosphere and settings.

For the audio art direction, several types of music and sounds are used; the atmospheres depicted in a city, for example, are not the same as those in a deserted valley, and this is largely due to the type of music chosen. 
In very large areas such as [valleys](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20World%2FMain%20places%2FNemean%20valley), slightly dynamic ambient music is recommended so that players can enjoy a dynamic soundscape while exploring an area and fighting enemies.
For a [city](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20World%2FMain%20places%2FTyrins) area, ambient music accompanied by instruments creates a warm atmosphere, and the sounds of people talking or reciting lines of dialogue make the area more dynamic and lively.
For a boss battle, the best choice is an epic style combined with rock or orchestral music. A boss battle should be difficult, and the music should also convey to the player that the task is a tough one. An epic style is best suited to conveying this emotion.
