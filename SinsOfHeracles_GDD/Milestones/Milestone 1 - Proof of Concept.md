## Proof of Concept (Core Gameplay Prototype)

**Goal:** Establish the foundation of combat, movement, and game feel. Validate the core gameplay loop before committing to full production. 

### Deliverables: 

> Core Player Controller: 
- Movement, rolling/dodging, stamina and health management. 
- Basic melee attacks (light/heavy) and hit detection. 

> Basic Enemy AI: 
- Simple melee enemy with patrol and attack behavior. 
- Combat testing with damage, stagger, and death feedback. 

> Prototype Level (Testing Arena): 
- Basic environment for combat testing (greybox/BasicMap). 

> Core Systems:   
- Lock-on camera. 
- Health/stamina UI. 
- Death and respawn mechanics. 

> Proof of Visual Identity: 
- Basic stylized art pass or sample asset integration to test tone.

**Purpose:** Confirm that the combat loop feels weighty, responsive, and satisfying, and that the technical framework (camera, input, AI) is ready to scale.
