## In the myth :
### Origin :

Heracles or Hercules in ancient Rome (literally meaning ‘the Glory of [Hera](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FNPCs%2FLore%20NPCs%2FHera)') is a hero from Greek mythology whose exploits have been sung by poets since around the 8th century BC. His most famous feat is the Twelve Labours, which took him from [Tiryns](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20World%2FMain%20places%2FTiryns) to the Underworld.

Heracles is the son of [Zeus](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FNPCs%2FLore%20NPCs%2FZeus), king of the gods and god of the sky and thunder, and Alcmene, wife of Amphitryon, king of Thebes and son of Alcaeus, king of Tiryns. One night, Zeus, taking advantage of Amphitryon's absence, transformed himself into him in order to seduce her. Heracles was born from this affair. Zeus then ordered Hermes to kidnap the child, his goal being to give him immortality by having him suckle at the breast of his wife, [Hera](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FNPCs%2FLore%20NPCs%2FHera), goddess of marriage and fertility. After this event, annoyed by Zeus' infidelities, Hera became furious and throughout Heracles' life felt a deep hatred and desire for revenge. During the night, she sent two snakes into the infant's cradle to kill him. But Heracles, already possessing superhuman strength from his father, strangled the snakes. Heracles' destiny was confirmed by a seer: he would accomplish great deeds and ascend to [Mount Olympus](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20World%2FLore%20places%2FMount%20Olympus), the residence of the gods.

### The Twelve Labours :

When he was in his twenties, Heracles married Megara, daughter of Creon, King of Thebes, with whom he had several children. During a family outing, he was suddenly seized by a powerful murderous rage. Hera, who had not forgotten the affront she had suffered, drove Heracles mad in order to satisfy her vengeance. He mistook his children and wife for wild beasts and violently murdered them.

Heracles, wishing to atone for his sin, travels to Delphi to consult the Oracle of Apollo. The Oracle orders him to go to [Tiryns](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20World%2FMain%20places%2FTiryns) and enter the service of King [Eurystheus](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FNPCs%2FEurystheus), his enemy.
Eurystheus ordered Hercules to perform twelve labours considered impossible to accomplish, after which he would be forgiven for his actions. These were:
- Kill the [Nemean lion](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Enemies%2FBosses%2FNemean%20Lion)
- Slay the [Lernaean Hydra](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Enemies%2FBosses%2FLernean%20Hydra)
- Bring back the Erymanthian boar alive
- Bring back the Ceryneian hind alive
- Clean the Augean stables in a single day
- Drive away the Stymphalian birds
- Bring back the Cretan bull of Minos
- Bring back the man-eating mares of Diomedes
- Bring back the golden girdle of Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons
- Bring back the cattle of the three-bodied giant Geryon
- Bring back the apples from the garden of the Hesperides
