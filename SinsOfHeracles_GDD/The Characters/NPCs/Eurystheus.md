Eurystheus, king of [Tiryns](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20World%2FMain%20places%2FTiryns), is the main antagonist of *[Sins of Heracles](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=Sins%20of%20Heracles)*. He is the one who commissions the Twelve Labours from [Heracles](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FHeracles), which constitutes the main quest of the game.

## In the myth :

Eurystheus was deeply jealous and envious of Heracles' strength and power, but also of his right to the throne of Argolis, the region in which Tiryns is located and of which Eurystheus is king. Even though his father was a god, he was the adopted son of Amphitryon, king of Thebes and son of the former king of Tiryns, and therefore posed a direct threat to Eurystheus' throne. To test him and ‘get rid’ of him, Eurystheus gave him twelve tasks that were considered impossible: these were the Twelve Labours.

According to the most famous version of the author Pseudo-Apollodorus, Eurystheus initially gives Heracles ten Labours to complete. However, he does not recognise the success of the second (kill the [Lernaean Hydra](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20Enemies%2FBosses%2FLernean%20Hydra)) or the fifth (clean the Augean stables in a single day). Heracles must therefore complete two additional Labours on top of those he failed.
## In *Sins of Heracles* :

In *Sins of Heracles*, Eurystheus initially gives twelve Labours to be completed, and the two that are considered failures in the myth count towards the king's tally.
