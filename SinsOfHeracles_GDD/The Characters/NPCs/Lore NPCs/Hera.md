## In the myth :

In Greek mythology, Hera is the goddess of marriage and fertility, queen of the gods and wife of [Zeus](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FNPCs%2FLore%20NPCs%2FZeus), king of the gods. Throughout the myths, she is portrayed as a jealous wife who constantly suffers her husband's infidelities and plots revenge against him.
She plays a very important role in the myth of [Heracles](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FHeracles), as it is she who triggers the hero's murderous rage, which leads to the quest of the Twelve Labours.

Hera, who suffers yet another betrayal from her spouse, is furious. Heracles has cheated on her again with a mortal woman and fathered a child, Heracles. While he sleeps, Hermes, on Zeus' orders, kidnaps the baby and feeds him from her breast, giving him immortality and divine strength. Following this affront, Hera now wishes to satisfy her vengeance and sends two snakes to kill Heracles in his cradle. But already possessing superhuman strength, he strangles the snakes and Hera's plan fails.

Heracles grew up and married Megara, daughter of the king of Thebes; four children were born from this union (up to eight, depending on the version). Hera, who had not forgotten the affront she had suffered, drove him mad with rage, and he violently murdered his entire family. She had finally succeeded in taking her revenge and destroying him. It was this event that led to Heracles' quest for redemption and the Twelve Labours.

Hera then plays a much smaller role in the myth, but watches Heracles' exploits during his Labours. During the ninth Labour, in which he must retrieve the belt of the queen of the Amazons, a tribe of warrior women, she transforms herself into an Amazon and informs the other warriors of Heracles' intention to kill their queen. This act almost causes him to fail the labour, but the queen sacrifices herself so that he can take the girdle.

After the Twelve Labours, Hera forgives Heracles and, upon his death, when he ascends to [Olympus](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20World%2FLore%20places%2FMount%20Olympus) in apotheosis, Hera even welcomes him as her son.
