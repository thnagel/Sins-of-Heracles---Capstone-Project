- Interacting with him triggers story progression and unlocks new zones  
- Provides context and stakes for the player’s actions, integrating story and gameplay

### **Interaction Philosophy**
The interaction systems are designed to:

- Reinforce **exploration** and engagement with the game world  
- Provide **meaningful choices** in resource allocation (Ichor, materials)  
- Allow players to **customize playstyle** through gear upgrades, consumables, and stats  
- Support **storytelling and world-building** through villagers, quests, and major NPCs  
- Integrate progression systems (crafting, leveling, and combat) into the world in a cohesive, intuitive way  

By connecting combat, progression, exploration, and narrative, player interactions remain impactful and engaging throughout the game.
