### **Crafting & Upgrade Rewards**
Engaging with the crafting system provides meaningful progression:

- Crafting new weapons unlocks **stronger movesets or playstyles**  
- Upgrading armor increases **survivability**, opening paths through more difficult zones

These rewards allow players to tailor their build and steadily increase power.

### **Milestone Rewards**
Major progression milestones grant special bonuses:

- **Defeating major bosses** may unlock new shrines or new NPC services such as extra wares at merchants or new crafting options at blacksmiths

### **Reward Philosophy**
The reward structure is designed to:

- Encourage **exploration**, **combat mastery**, and **resource management**  
- Provide **meaningful, tangible progression** without excessive loot clutter  
- Support diverse **playstyles** through stat growth and gear customization  
- Maintain a loop where effort in combat and exploration directly fuels player strength  

Rewards should feel impactful, earned, and tied to the world’s systems in a cohesive way.
