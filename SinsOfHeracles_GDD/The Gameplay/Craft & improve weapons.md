## **Weapon Crafting & Upgrading**

### **Weapon Crafting**

Weapons can be crafted at **any blacksmith** the player encounters.

* Requires a **specific set of materials** depending on the weapon type and tier
* Materials are **primarily obtained by defeating enemies**
* Higher-tier weapons demand **rarer drops** and larger quantities
* Encourages exploration and combat to gather resources

### **Weapon Upgrading**

Existing weapons can be **upgraded** to increase their effectiveness rather than always crafting new ones.

* **Upgrade Types:** Increases to base damage, attack speed, stamina efficiency, or added special modifiers (e.g., elemental damage, critical chance)
* **Upgrade Tiers:** Weapons have discrete tiers (e.g., +1 to +5) that require progressively rarer materials
* **Upgrade Locations:** Upgrades are applied at blacksmiths; higher-tier upgrades may require specialized forges or master blacksmiths

### **Material Acquisition**

Materials are dropped by enemies, with rarity tied to enemy type and difficulty:

* **Common enemies** drop standard crafting and low-tier upgrade materials
* **Elite enemies** drop advanced or rare materials suitable for mid-tier upgrades
* **Bosses** drop unique items required for high-tier crafting or upgrades

### **Crafting & Upgrade Philosophy**

The weapon crafting and upgrade loop is designed to:

* Reward consistent combat and exploration
* Provide clear progression through weapon upgrades rather than forcing constant replacement
* Allow players to invest in a favored weapon and grow it over time
* Keep upgrades meaningful and balanced so choices feel impactful
