## **Player Progression**

### **Experience System**
The game uses a **Souls-like progression system**.  
Enemies drop a resource called **Ichor**, which the player uses to level up their character.

- Ichor is lost upon death but can be retrieved if the player returns to the point of death. *(Optional mechanic — add only if desired.)*  
- Leveling up allows the player to allocate points into core stats.

### **Core Stats**
Leveling grants stat points that can be assigned to four main attributes:

- **Strength** – Increases melee damage output 
- **Dexterity** – Improves ranged weapon damage and precision  
- **Vitality** – Increases maximum health and enhances general defenses  
- **Endurance** – Increases stamina, stamina recovery, and carry weight

### **Gear Upgrades**
Weapons and armor can be **upgraded using materials** found throughout levels or dropped by enemies.

- Higher-tier upgrades require rarer materials  
- Upgraded gear offers improved damage, defenses, resistances, or unique bonuses  
- Gear upgrades complement stat progression, allowing players to scale both character attributes and equipment strength
