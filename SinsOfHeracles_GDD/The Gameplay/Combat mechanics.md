Blocking mechanics depending on equipped gear: 
- The bow is unable to block
- Swords are capable of blocking and is the most efficient
- Clubs are capable blocking, less efficient than swords

Limited healing resource, replenished upon death (Gifted ambrosia) acting as "estus flasks".

 ### **Gameplay Loop**
---

**Core Gameplay loop:** 
The primary gameplay loop is combat with the enemies barring the way to the current level’s boss and the boss itself, all of which will respawn and regain all their health upon the player’s death.

**Other loops:** The secondary loops will be using the various resources obtained from killing enemies, said resources could be used to level up your stats/skill tree, buying equipment and consumables and upgrading said equipment. Upon clearing a chapter, talking with the king (through dialog or cutscene) lets us know what our next labor is.
