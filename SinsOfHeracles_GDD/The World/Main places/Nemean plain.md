Nemea is an ancient city and sanctuary dedicated to [Zeus](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FNPCs%2FLore%20NPCs%2FZeus) located in the [Peloponnese](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20World%2FLore%20places%2FPeloponnese), in Corinthia. The city is famous for being the place where [Heracles](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FHeracles) killed the [Nemean lion](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20Enemies%2FBosses%2FNemean%20Lion), as well as for its Nemean Games, one of the four Panhellenic sporting competitions held every two years in honour of the king of the gods.

## In *Sins of Heracles*

In [*Sins of Heracles*](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=Sins%20of%20Heracles), the village of Nemea is located on a wide plain dotted with hills and rocks. The terrain is almost arid, and in many places you can see the earth directly. Players will find the small village of Nemea, where a few dozen citizens live.

The plain of Nemea is the first area of the game that is not the central hub, namely [Tiryns](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20World%2FMain%20places%2FTiryns), and is the area where the player must complete the first Labour, killing the Nemean lion.

### Village of Nemea

When arriving in the region, the player appears directly in the village of Nemea, located at the entrance to the plain between two hills. The village is peaceful and serves as a supply point for the many travellers who pass through, or a place of pilgrimage where Greeks go to pray to Zeus.
To the north of the village, carved into the hillside, is an amphitheatre where citizens gather to watch theatrical performances and listen to singing. At the top of the stands is a small altar to Zeus where priests and pilgrims gather to pray. The centre is the heart of the village.
The central square brings together citizens, merchants and blacksmiths. Players can buy medical care and forge or upgrade their equipment without having to return to Tiryns. You can see citizens talking to each other, poets and cupbearers singing poems and stories, hear the sounds of anvils and hammers, etc. The central square is surrounded by a few houses.
To the west and south are the remaining houses of the citizens of Nemea, about seven or eight dwellings. Players cannot enter the houses. However, they can enter the inn, which allows them to restore their health and stamina, but causes defeated monsters to reappear.
Finally, at the southern and eastern ends of the village, you can find the village gates. If the player wishes to return to Tiryns, they simply need to pass through the southern gate. If they wish to venture into the plain, they must take the eastern gate.

### Outside the village

Outside the village, in the plain of Nemea, the player explores a vast rocky and hilly area where we can find different types of environment and some monsters.

### Stadion of the Nemean Games

To the north-east of the Nemean plain lies the stadion where the Nemean Games were held. It is a long earthen field surrounded by stones where athletes practised various sports. Next to the stadium is a temple dedicated to Zeus where the opening and closing ceremonies of the games took place.
It is in this area that the player must face the Nemean lion and complete the first Labour.

### The enemies :

In the Nemean plain area, players will encounter various monsters and creatures that they can battle in order to gain experience and increase their stats, as well as collect materials that can be used to forge or upgrade equipment. These enemies are recurring, but as they are relatively technical and powerful, they are few in number. If players wish to make them reappear, they will have to rest at the inn or return to Tiryns.

Numerous hills dot the plain, and [harpies](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20Enemies%2FMobs%2FHarpies) have built their nests at the top of some of them. Around each nest, one or two harpies can be fought.

In contrast, in the flatter areas between the hills, a few [chimeras](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20Enemies%2FMobs%2FChimeras) can be encountered and fought.

Finally, in the stadion to the north-east of the plain, the [Nemean lion](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20Enemies%2FBosses%2FNemean%20Lion), which is the final challenge in this area, must be fought and defeated in order to complete the area. Unlike the other monsters, the lion cannot be revived once it has been defeated.
