The city is located on a 30-metre hill and consists mainly of the palace of Tiryns, where the king of the city lives, in the southern part. In the centre was a square with a large hearth, providing access to the palace through a propylaea and to the northern part. In the latter, there was a triangular roofed area that provided protection for the inhabitants in case of danger.
