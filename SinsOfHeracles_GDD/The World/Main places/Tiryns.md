Tiryns is an ancient Greek city in the [Peloponnese](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20World%2FLore%20places%2FPeloponnese), in Argolis. The city is located on a 30-metre hill and consists mainly of the palace of Tiryns, where the king of the city lives, in the southern part. In the centre was a square with a large hearth, providing access to the palace through a propylaea and to the northern part. In the latter, there was a triangular roofed area that provided protection for the inhabitants in case of danger.

## In the myth :

In the myth of [Heracles](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FHeracles), the city of Tiryns is the focal point of his quest to complete the Twelve Labours. It was to this city that he was sent by the Oracle of [Delphi](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20World%2FLore%20places%2FDelphi) to serve King [Eurystheus](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FNPCs%2FEurystheus).

## In *Sins of Heracles* :

Dans *Sins of Heracles*, Tirynthe est relativement similaire à ce à quoi ressemblait la ville en réalité. Elle est cependant beaucoup plus grande que l'originelle (plusieurs centaines de mètres).
L'entrée de la ville se situe au sud, en haut d'un grand escalier permettant de monter en haut de la colline.
