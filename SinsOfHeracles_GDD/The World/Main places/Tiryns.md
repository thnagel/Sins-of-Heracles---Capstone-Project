Tiryns is an ancient Greek city in the Peloponnese, in Argolis. The city is located on a 30-metre hill and consists mainly of the palace of Tiryns, where the king of the city lives, in the southern part. In the centre was a square with a large hearth, providing access to the palace through a propylaea and to the northern part. In the latter, there was a triangular roofed area that provided protection for the inhabitants in case of danger.

## In the myth :

In the myth of [Heracles](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FHeracles), the city of Tiryns is the focal point of his quest to complete the Twelve Labours. It was to this city that he was sent by the Oracle of [Delphi](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20World%2FLore%20places%2FDelphi) to serve King [Eurystheus](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FNPCs%2FEurystheus).

## In *Sins of Heracles* :

In *Sins of Heracles*, Tiryns is relatively similar to what the city actually looked like. However, it is much larger than the original (several hundred metres).

The entrance to the city is located to the south, at the top of a large staircase leading up the hill. Players spawn on the map at the bottom of this staircase.

In the centre of the city is the main square, where you can find numerous NPCs and merchants.

Heading east, you will find the houses of the inhabitants of Tiryns scattered along a central alleyway and then in small side streets. On the main street, you will find the blacksmith, who will help you upgrade your equipment.

Finally, to the east of the city, you will find the palace of Tiryns, the residence of King Eurystheus. To access the palace courtyard, a propylaea starting from the central square runs along the northern ramparts, circles around, and returns inside the walls to the central courtyard. Opposite the main entrance is a small temple of Hera with a statue inside. From there, you can enter the palace directly and arrive in the throne room. On either side of the throne are corridors leading to other rooms in the palace.
