Lerna is a coastal area located in the Peloponnese, in what is now Argos-Mycenae. Around the 3rd century BC, it was a major trading area in the Aegean Sea.
The Lerna Marsh is a vast, muddy wetland. It is the second area in [*Sins of Heracles*](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=Sins%20of%20Heracles), and the [Lernaean Hydra](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20Enemies%2FBosses%2FLernean%20Hydra) is the final boss of this area.

## In *Sins of Heracles* :

In *Sins of Heracles*, the player appears directly in the Lerna Marsh. A path leading from the coastal area to the marsh brings them there. The player's spawn point is marked by two pillars and a stone path.

The Lerna Marsh area consists mainly of small muddy ponds and marshes. They are shallow enough for the player to walk through. The entire area is very muddy and wet, and there are many trees, including mangroves and pollarded trees, bushes and dead tree trunks.

In the centre of the marsh is a huge clearing with a large pond in the middle. Like the others, this pond is not deep and players can walk through it without any problems.
## The enemies :

In the Lerna Marsh, players can face two types of recurring enemies: [Gorgons](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20Enemies%2FMobs%2FGorgons) and [Satyrs](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20Enemies%2FMobs%2FSatyr). As the area is relatively uniform and the terrain is fairly similar, they are placed randomly and cannot be found in the same locations each time they reappear.

In the clearing in the centre of the marsh, players can and must face the final boss of the area, the Lernaean Hydra. It stands in the centre of the pond and can only move as far as the edge of the clearing.
