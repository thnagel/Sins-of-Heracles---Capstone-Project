Mount Olympus is a Greek mountain located in Thessaly, rising to an altitude of 2,918 metres. Although the names coincide, the ancient Olympic Games held in Olympia are not located in the same place as Mount Olympus.

At the end of his life, Heracles ascended Mount Olympus in apotheosis and was made an Olympian god by his father Zeus.

In *Sins of Heracles*, there is no way to ascend Mount Olympus, as it is not a designated area in the game.
