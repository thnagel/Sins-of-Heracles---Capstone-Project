## In the myths :

In mythology, satyrs are anthropomorphic creatures with horse legs and ears, but more commonly depicted as half-man, half-goat hybrids. Satyrs are depicted alongside Dionysus, god of wine and theatre, and form his retinue.

## In *Sins of Heracles* :

In [*Sins of Heracles*](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=Sins%20of%20Heracles), satyrs are recurring monsters that can be found in the [Lerna Marsh](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20World%2FMain%20places%2FLerna%20Marsh) and are more violent creatures than in myths. They are therefore hybrids, half man, half goat, of average human size. They have a long horn which they use to stun their opponents and then attack them by charging.
