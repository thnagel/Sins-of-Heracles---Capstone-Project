The Lernaean Hydra is the boss of the [Lerna Marsh](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20World%2FMain%20places%2FLerna%20Marsh). It is therefore the final battle in the second area of [*Sins of Heracles*](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=Sins%20of%20Heracles) and the second Labour of [Heracles](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FHeracles).

## Description :

The Lernaean Hydra is a gigantic serpent with between five and nine heads, one of which is immortal. The other heads grow back when cut off. The Hydra's blood is also a powerful poison that consumes everything it touches.

### In the myth :

During his battle with the Hydra, Heracles first tried to cut off its heads before realising that they grew back once severed. Thanks to the advice of Athena, goddess of war and wisdom, Heracles asked his nephew Iolaus to burn the stumps with a burning brand for each head he cut off. This technique worked on all the heads, which no longer grew back. He then buried the last immortal head and thus defeated the Lernaean Hydra.
Heracles finally dipped his arrows in the Hydra's blood to make each of his shots deadly.

In Pseudo-Apollodorus' version of the myth, Eurystheus rejects the validity of this labour because Heracles was helped by Iolaus. He must therefore complete one more labour for him, as well as an additional one for the fifth (cleaning the Augean stables in a single day).

### In *Sins of Heracles* :

In *Sins of Heracles*, the Lernaean Hydra has ‘only’ five heads. Each head is independent and can attack the player independently. The Hydra's heads cannot be cut off during the fight, and it will keep them all until the final phase. It can also spit venom/poison and is extremely fast and agile.
