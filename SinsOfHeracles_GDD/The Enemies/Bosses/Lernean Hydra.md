The Lernaean Hydra is the boss of the [Lerna Marsh](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20World%2FMain%20places%2FLerna%20Marsh). It is therefore the final battle in the second area of [*Sins of Heracles*](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=Sins%20of%20Heracles) and the second Labour of [Heracles](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FHeracles).

## Description :

The Lernaean Hydra is a gigantic serpent with between five and nine heads, one of which is immortal. The other heads grow back when cut off. The Hydra's blood is also a powerful poison that consumes everything it touches.

### In the myth :

During his battle with the Hydra, Heracles first tried to cut off its heads before realising that they grew back once severed. Thanks to the advice of Athena, goddess of war and wisdom, Heracles asked his nephew Iolaus to burn the stumps with a burning brand for each head he cut off. This technique worked on all the heads, which no longer grew back. He then buried the last immortal head and thus defeated the Lernaean Hydra.
Heracles finally dipped his arrows in the Hydra's blood to make each of his shots deadly.

In Pseudo-Apollodorus' version of the myth, Eurystheus rejects the validity of this labour because Heracles was helped by Iolaus. He must therefore complete one more labour for him, as well as an additional one for the fifth (cleaning the Augean stables in a single day).

### In *Sins of Heracles* :

In *Sins of Heracles*, the Lernaean Hydra has ‘only’ five heads. Each head is independent and can attack the player independently. It can also spit venom/poison and is extremely fast and agile.

## Fight :
The hydra will fight by swinging his heads to bite horizontally in a wide arc or vertically and will also spit poison at a distance in a small circular area which will poison the player if he is hit, lowering his health over time, it will also create holes of deeper water in the arena which will slow down the player when he steps through it. The hydra will lose a head and switch phase every time he loses 20% of his hp
### Phase 1 :
During the first phase (between 100% and 80% of it's health) only one head will attack at a time switching between the hydra's different attacks

### Phase 2 :
During the second phase (between 80% and 60% of it's health) two head will attack at the same time both of them using the same or different attacks as they cycle through the hydra's different attacks

### Phase 3 :
During the third phase (between 60% and 40% of it's health) all three of it's remaining heads will attack at the same time in the same manner as phase 2 and it's health will begin slowly regenerating forcing the player to play more offensively

### Phase 4 :
The fourth phase (between 40% and 20% of it's health) will be similar to the second phase as the remaining two heads will attack together but the frequency of attacks will be faster making this phase easier than the third but harder than the second. The regeneration will also stop.

### Phase 5:
During the last phase the hydra will be exhausted and it's last head will attack less often and the hydra will move slower letting plenty of opportunities for the player to damage and kill it
