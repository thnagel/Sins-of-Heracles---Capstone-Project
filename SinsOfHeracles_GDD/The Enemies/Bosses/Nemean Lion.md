The Nemean Lion is the boss of the [Nemean plain](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20World%2FMain%20places%2FNemean%20plain). It is therefore the final fight of the first area of _[Sins of Heracles](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=Sins%20of%20Heracles)_ as well as the first Labor of [Heracles](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FHeracles).
## Description:

The Nemean Lion stands out due to its size; it is approximately twice as large as a standard lion.  
It is also characterized by its extremely tough, almost impenetrable skin and its immense strength.

### In the myth:

In the myth of the Twelve Labors, Heracles first tries to attack it with a bow. However, the arrows he shoots simply bounce off the lion’s skin. He then attempts to knock it out with his club, which also proves useless. Finally, he decides to strangle the lion with all his strength, which ultimately ends the reign of the Nemean Lion.
Heracles then uses the lion’s claws to cut its skin and make a cuirass, and uses the skull as a helmet.

### In _Sins of Heracles_:

For gameplay purposes, the Nemean Lion can be defeated with regular attacks and therefore does not need to be strangled like in the myth.

## Fight:
During the fight the lion will attack with claw attacks, bites and charges forward into the player followed by a claw attack

### Phase 1:
During the first phase the lion will attack less often giving time for the player to counter with his own attacks

### Phase 2:
Once the lion reaches 50% of it's health it will enter phase 2 and jump in the air to crash into the player in a big area of effect dealing large damage. It will then go bak to it's normal attack pattern but will attack much more frequently forcing the player to time his attacks and dodges well in order to hit the boss without getting hit back.
