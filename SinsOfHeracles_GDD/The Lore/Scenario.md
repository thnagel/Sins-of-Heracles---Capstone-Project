[Heracles](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FHeracles), son of Zeus and Alcmene, a demigod, travels to the Greek city of [Tiryns](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHeracles_GDD&file=The%20World%2FMain%20places%2FTiryns), in [Peloponnese](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20World%2FLore%20places%2FPeloponnese). This was sent by the oracle of Delphi to King [Eurystheus](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FNPCs%2FEurystheus). The reason? Heracles committed a major crime: he murdered his wife and children. He must therefore atone to the gods and serve Eurystheus.

Eurystheus then gives him twelve tasks that are considered impossible to accomplish, and each completed task will reveal the next one. These are the Twelve Labours. Only by successfully completing these twelve tasks will he be forgiven and able to leave Eurystheus' service.

In [*Sins of Heracles*](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=Sins%20of%20Heracles), Heracles must therefore accomplish the first two labours: kill the [Nemean lion](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Enemies%2FBosses%2FNemean%20Lion) and slay the [Lernaean Hydra](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Enemies%2FBosses%2FLernean%20Hydra).
