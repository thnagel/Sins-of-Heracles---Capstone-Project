This section will describe the specific steps involved in the complete process of *[Sins of Heracles](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=Sins%20of%20Heracles)*.

## Introduction :

The game begins with a cutscene showing [Heracles](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FHeracles) walking along a path. The camera moves to film his back, and the city of [Tiryns](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20World%2FMain%20places%2FTyrins). Le titre du jeu apparaît donc et un fondu au noir s'enchaîne.

The game title then appears, followed by a fade to black.

The screen lights up again and the player can directly control Heracles. He is located just outside the city. The player can see a direction indicated on a mini map, and below the map, an objective is annotated: ‘Go to the palace of Tiryns’. The player must therefore enter the city and reach the palace to continue the quest.
When the player passes through the gates of Tiryns, a text appears with the name of the area they have entered. The player must therefore cross the city, its streets full of Greek citizens, to reach the palace. During this journey, they can begin to take control of the character and learn each key and each movement.

The player finally enters the palace, and as before, a text appears with the name of the palace of Tiryns, and they find themselves directly in the throne room. A fade to black cuts the scene and we see Heracles facing the king [Eurystheus](obsidian://open?vault=SinsOfHercales_GDD&file=The%20Characters%2FNPCs%2FEurystheus), seated on his throne. A camera movement shows Heracles on the left and Eurystheus on the right, and a dialogue ensues.
