# Slapageddon -- Sprint 4

This repository contains the casptone project developed at **Epitech Berlin**, where we were tasked with creating a simple game
with lots of juice and polish.

## 📦 Required Asset Packs

The project relies on several free asset packs. If you want to open and
run the project in **UE5** (not just play the build), make sure to
download the following:

-   [52 Card Decks](https://www.fab.com/listings/57e8bc76-6f19-4b5e-bf09-e912eba4c88f)

## 🚀 Getting Started

-   Clone the repository.
-   Download and install the required asset packs.
-   Open the project in **Unreal Engine 5**.
-   Play the build or explore the project to see how the mechanics are
    implemented.
